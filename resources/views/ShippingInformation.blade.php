Our UPS Ground Flat $11.99 (Continental USA Only) shipping method applies to orders up to 10 pounds in weight and within the continental USA only. Each additional 10 pounds will cost you an additional $1  (up to 200 lbs). Orders over 200 lbs will be adjusted at our office and customers will be contacted with the correct shipping charges. Refrigerated and frozen items are excluded. If your order includes any refrigerated or frozen items, please check below for Frozen and Refrigerated instructions. Orders to Alaska and Hawaii need to be shipped via either UPS Next Day or 2nd Day Air services. <br>

If your total order weighs more than 40 Lbs., your order will be shipped in more than one package. This means that the maximum weight in a single package can not exceed 40 Lbs. <br>

Wenfee carefully packages every order to insure safety and freshness, and uses the best packaging materials for all shipments. If, for any reason, your order does not arrive in a satisfactory condition, call or e-mail us within 24 hours of receipt of the order. Please save all packaging materials together so that a damage assessment can be made and we fix the problem accordingly. <br>

Frozen and Refrigerated items are shipped on Monday and Tuesday of every week with UPS regular ground service to Maryland, District of Columbia, and Northern Virginia. Frozen and refrigerated items for all other areas are shipped UPS Next Day Air or UPS 2nd Day Air delivery. Please select the appropriate shipping method when your order contains refrigerated and/or frozen items. <br>

We reserve the right to change the carrier given that it will take the same or less number of days to arrive to you compared to the original shipping method that you selected. <br>

If you have any question about your order, please do not hesitate to contact our orders department. <br> <br>
